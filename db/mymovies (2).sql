She wishes to succeed her father as Sultan but is instead expected to marry one of her royal suitors. Jafar, the Grand Vizier, schemes to overthrow the Sultan and seeks a magic lamp that only \"the diamond in the rough\" can retrieve.\r\n\r\nWhile sneaking into the royal palace to visit Jasmine, Aladdin and Abu are captured by Jafar. He offers to make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine in exchange for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Once there, Aladdin frees a magic carpet and finds the lamp. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who double-crosses him and kicks him and Abu into the cave, but Abu steals the lamp back.\r\n\r\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent Genie inside, who has the power to grant three wishes to anyone who has the lamp. Aladdin gets them out of the cave without using a wish, on a technicality. Determined to woo Jasmine, he uses his official first wish to become a prince and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human.\r\n\r\nAladdin makes an extravagant arrival at Agrabah as \"Prince Ali of Ababwa\", but he struggles to impress Jasmine. Posing as Aladdin\'s human attendant, the Genie is mutually smitten with Dalia, Jasmine\'s handmaiden. Aladdin and Jasmine bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet. Tricked into revealing his true identity, he lies to her, saying that he actually is a prince and dressed like a peasant to explore Agrabah.\r\n\r\nWhen Jafar discovers Aladdin\'s identity, he kidnaps Aladdin and throws him into the palace moat and into the sea, knowing that if he survives, it will prove that he has the lamp. The Genie rescues Aladdin, costing him his second wish. Once rescued, Aladdin returns to the palace and destroys Jafar\'s magic cobra staff, ending his spell over the Sultan and revealing his plot. Jafar is then arrested and imprisoned in the dungeons. The Sultan allows Aladdin to marry Jasmine. Aladdin goes back on his promise to free the Genie, feeling uncertain of being able to keep up his charade without him. Dismayed that Aladdin will continue living a lie, the Genie retreats to his lamp.\r\n\r\nFreed by his parrot sidekick Iago, Jafar steals the lamp and becomes the Genie\'s new master. He uses his first wish to become sultan and his second one to become the world\'s most powerful sorcerer. Jafar then exposes Aladdin, exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland, and tortures the Sultan and Dalia until Jasmine agrees to marry him. The Genie secretly teleports the magic carpet to rescue Aladdin and Abu behind Jafar\'s back. At the wedding, as Aladdin returns to Agrabah, Jasmine does not want to marry Jafar. She steals the lamp from him and jumps onto the magic carpet. Jafar uses a sand twister to recapture Aladdin and Jasmine and destroy the magic carpet.\r\n\r\nAs Jafar holds Jasmine, Dalia, and the Sultan under his magic, Aladdin taunts Jafar for being second in power to the Genie, goading him into using his last wish to become \"the most powerful being in the universe\". Jafar turns into a genie and becomes trapped inside his own lamp, dragging Iago with him, and the Genie banishes them to the Cave of Wonders. Abu rescues the magic carpet and Genie fixes it up. Jasmine, Dalia, and the Sultan are freed from Jafar\'s magic. The Genie encourages Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title and legally marry Jasmine. Aladdin instead keeps his promise and frees the Genie by using his last wish, allowing him to live as a human. Dalia, the Genie, and the Sultan know that Jasmine loves Aladdin. The Sultan crowns Jasmine the new sultana-regnant, no longer bound to marry a prince, and she and Aladdin marry. The Genie marries Dalia, and they start a family and explore the parallel world together, with the Genie becoming the mariner who is telling his children the story about Aladdin in the beginning of the film.', 'Aladdin _ Hindi Trailer 2019 [HD].mp4'),

There, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Samantha \"Sam\" Shane, daughter of Admiral Terrance Shane. Alex’s brother, Commander Stone Hopper, forces Alex to join the U.S. Navy. Six years later, Alex is a lieutenant aboard the USS John Paul Jones and in a relationship with Sam, a physical therapist working with wounded veterans. While Stone is a model officer commanding the USS Sampson, the rebellious Alex, while showing plenty of potential, is facing a disciplinary discharge.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2012 RIMPAC exercise, five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship hits a satellite and crashes through the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, while the others plunge into the waters off the coast of Hawaii. Sampson, John Paul Jones, and Japanese destroyer JDS Myōkō discover a floating structure that generates an impenetrable force field isolating the Hawaiian Islands and the three destroyers from the rest of the world, and jamming all radar and communications inside. Three alien warships surface and open fire; Myōkō is destroyed, Sampson is lost with all hands including Stone, and John Paul Jones’ command crew are killed, leaving Alex to reluctantly assume command as the highest-ranking sailor on board. John Paul Jones disengages to recover Myōkō’s survivors, including Captain Yugi Nagata, while alien drones destroy Oahu’s military bases.\r\n\r\nHiking near the communications array, Sam and retired US Army lieutenant colonel and double amputee Mick Canales discover the aliens\' presence. They encounter scientist Cal Zapata, who reveals the aliens have taken over the array to re-establish communications with their home planet. The John Paul Jones’ crew captures an alien which telepathically links with Alex, revealing their history of conquering worlds. More aliens board and retrieve their comrade while one starts sabotaging the ship. Its armored suit proves impervious to small-arms fire but is obliterated by the destroyer’s 5-inch gun, and the captured alien\'s helmet reveals their eyes are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Mick, and Zapata recover his spectrum analyzer, using it to radio John Paul Jones that the aliens will contact their planet and most likely call for reinforcements when the facility’s satellite is in position in four hours.\r\n\r\nAs night falls, Captain Nagata suggests using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami warning buoys around Hawaii to track the warships without radar; this plan works and allows John Paul Jones to destroy two of them. The third proves too elusive, so they lure it into facing east as the sun rises. Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows with sniper rifles, blinding its crew with sunlight and allowing John Paul Jones to destroy it. The destroyer then attempts to target the communications array, but is sunk by drones launched from the alien structure emitting the force field; Alex, Nagata, and several other sailors barely escape.\r\n\r\nThe survivors commandeer the decommissioned World War II battleship USS Missouri with the aid of retired Navy veterans. The floating structure is revealed to be a giant mothership, but Missouri disables the force field, allowing Admiral Shane to scramble fighter jets from the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. The battleship’s turret carrying the ship’s last shell is disabled, forcing the sailors to carry the shell to the ship\'s last functioning turret. Sam, Mick, and Cal stall the aliens at the array, where Mick kills an alien soldier. Alex uses the final shell to destroy the array, rendering the Missouri defenseless, but the mothership’s drones are destroyed by Boeing F/A-18 fighter jets, as reinforcements carpet bomb the mothership, eliminating the alien threat.\r\n\r\nAlex is promoted to lieutenant commander and presented with a Silver Star and his brother\'s posthumous Navy Cross. Admiral Shane promises Alex will soon have a ship of his own, while he is also recommended to become a Navy SEAL. Alex asks him for Sam’s hand in marriage, and the admiral initially refuses but invites Alex to lunch.', 'Battleship (2012) Official HD Trailer Debut.mp4'),

He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the \"one who sits above the Table\". In response, High Table member Marquis Vincent Bisset de Gramont summons New York Continental Hotel manager Winston and his concierge Charon, where he explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to kill John and chastises Winston for previously failing to do so. As punishment, the Marquis strips Winston of his managerial duties, declares him \"excommunicado\", destroys the New York Continental and executes Charon. The Marquis then enlists Caine – a blind, retired High Table assassin – to kill his old friend John, threatening to murder Caine\'s daughter.\r\n\r\nJohn takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji. The Marquis\' second-in-command Chidi, backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel. Koji\'s daughter Akira, the hotel\'s concierge, evacuates the hotel just before the High Table \"deconsecrates\" it, igniting a melee. John fights through waves of armored assassins, leading to a showdown against Caine. A bounty hunter named Mr. Nobody interrupts their fight and allows John to escape after determining the current bounty for killing John to be insufficient. A wounded Koji repeatedly attacks Caine on John\'s behalf, until Caine reluctantly kills Koji, but spares Akira.\r\n\r\nJohn returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon\'s gravesite. Winston suggests that John invoke an old High Table tradition to challenge the Marquis to a duel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. John travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, with whom he had severed ties, to request readmission. His adoptive sister Katia stipulates that for readmission, John must kill Killa Harkan, a High Table member who was paid by the Marquis to murder her father. Killa sets up an ambush at his nightclub, but with the aid of Caine and Mr. Nobody, John manages to kill him and regain his status. Winston relays John\'s challenge to the Marquis, acting as John\'s \'second\' and requests that, should John win, his excommunicado be revoked and the New York Continental be rebuilt, fully funded by the High Table; should John lose, however, Winston would also die as the challenger\'s \'second\'.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, John and the Marquis decide on the duel\'s parameters – dueling pistols at sunrise the following day at Sacré-Cœur – in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger, the Table\'s emissary. The Marquis nominates a reluctant Caine to take his place, while the Harbinger warns that both John and Winston will be executed should either fail to appear on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol (9mm Pit Viper) and a new ballistic suit. The Marquis intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him. John fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacré-Cœur, including Mr. Nobody, who negotiates a bounty increase to $40 million. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody\'s dog, causing Mr. Nobody to abandon his pursuit of John.\r\n\r\nAfter Caine and Mr. Nobody assist John in fighting off several assassins – including Chidi, whom Mr. Nobody kills – on the Rue Foyatier, they reach the summit just in time for the duel. John and Caine wound each other through two rounds of dueling, and the third round comes to a halt when Caine severely wounds John. Demanding the right to administer the coup de grâce, the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis for his arrogance, revealing that John has not yet fired his third bullet. John then promptly executes the Marquis with a headshot, ending the duel. The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table and Winston\'s reinstatement of Hotel Manager of the New York Continental, which will be rebuilt with the High Table\'s funds.

The same day, DJ\'s parents leave for a convention, placing him in the care of teenage babysitter Elizabeth (Zee). Later, DJ\'s friend Chowder loses a basketball in Nebbercracker\'s lawn; the boys try to retrieve it, but Nebbercracker stops them. He appears to suffer a heart attack and is taken away by an ambulance; DJ and Chowder assume he is dead.\r\n\r\nZee\'s intoxicated boyfriend Bones arrives. He reveals that, many years ago, Nebbercracker stole his kite. Bones also relates rumors that Nebbercracker killed and ate his wife. After Zee throws him out, Bones notices his kite on Nebbercracker\'s porch, tries to retrieve it, and is devoured by the house. DJ and Chowder are attacked by the house when they investigate; the next day is Halloween. They save young Jenny Bennett, who is selling Halloween candy, from being eaten by the house. Jenny calls police officers Landers and Lister, but the house stays quiet when the officers arrive, and they dismiss the report.\r\n\r\nThe trio consults supernatural expert Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski, who speculates the house must be a rare monster created by the merging of a human ghost and a man-made object, only unbound when its heart is destroyed. Concluding Nebbercracker has died and possessed the house, the children construct a dummy child, filling it with cough syrup they stole from Chowder\'s parents\' pharmacy. They offer the dummy to the house to eat, hoping to put the house to sleep so they can find its \"heart\" (the chimney). Landers and Lister arrive and discover the stolen medicine; as they try to arrest the children, the house eats them, the children, and the police car. Separated from the officers, who seem to have vanished, the children explore the sleeping house\'s basement. They find all the stolen toys, and a shrine to Nebbercracker\'s wife, Constance the Giantess, whose skeleton is encased in cement. The house awakens and attacks them, but they trigger its gag reflex by grabbing its uvula equivalent (the chandelier), forcing it to vomit them outside.\r\n\r\nNebbercracker returns from the hospital alive, and reveals to the children that Constance is the spirit possessing the house. When he fell in love with her, she was an unwilling participant in a circus freak show due to her obesity, living in a cage and tormented by people throwing things at her. He helped her escape and married her. On Halloween, during the house\'s construction, some children threw eggs at Constance; tormented and enraged, she grabbed an axe. Nebbercracker tried to stop her, only to be knocked out as she stumbled and fell into the unfinished basement to her death, her body accidentally being coated in cement. Nebbercracker finished the house in Constance\'s memory, but her vengeful spirit merged with it, and she became the Monster House. For the next 45 years, Nebbercracker assumed a hostile demeanor to protect innocent people from her.\r\n\r\nDJ convinces Nebbercracker that he needs to let Constance go. Overhearing this, Constance becomes enraged, using two trees to lift herself from her foundation and chase the children and Nebbercracker off. Nebbercracker tries to comfort Constance, and explains everything is for the best, but when she sees he intends to destroy her with a dynamite, she attacks him. Chowder uses an excavator to attack Constance and lure her into a pit in a construction site; she falls, but changes shape instead of dying. Jenny lights the dynamite, and DJ swings out on a crane\'s hook with it, dropping it into the chimney and destroying the house. Finally freed, Constance\'s spirit briefly reunites with her husband before ascending to the afterlife.

He tells the two men of the prophecy, in which one (either Moses or Ramesses) will save the other and become a leader. During the battle, Moses saves Ramesses\' life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses volunteers to go to the city of Pithom in place of his cousin to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave Joshua being lashed and is appalled by the conditions of the slaves. Moses meets with the slave elders to see if the slaves are planning on sedition as claimed by the Viceroy. After said meetings, Moses receives a message via Joshua that Nun is looking for him. Moses finds Nun in the prayer house where Nun informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister Miriam to be raised by Pharaoh\'s daughter (he was born during the extermination of the Jewish heirs). Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily; during which he is attacked by two guards whom he quickly kills. However, two Hebrews overhear Nun\'s story and report it to the Viceroy.\r\n\r\nMoses returns home where soon after Seti dies, and Ramesses becomes the new Pharaoh (Ramesses II). Hegep reveals Moses\'s true lineage to Ramesses, but Ramesses is unconvinced. At the urging of Queen Tuya, he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses\'s sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off her arm, Moses intervenes and confirms he is a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses killed, Ramesses, still unwilling to believe the story, exiles him instead. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of Moshe. Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to Midian where he meets Zipporah and her father, Jethro. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah, and has a son, Gershom.\r\n\r\nYears later, Moses is injured in a rockslide. He encounters a burning bush and a boy, a messenger of the God of Abraham called Malak.[5] While recovering, Moses reveals his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, but Moses leaves anyway. In Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, and meets his brother Aaron for the first time. Moses confronts Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that freeing them is economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses\'s life, Ramesses orders Moses\'s death, and the killing of random Hebrew families until Moses is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves and leads them in an insurgency, prompting Ramesses to retaliate harshly. God\'s messenger appears to Moses and explains that ten plagues will affect Egypt. The first nine plagues deal massive damage to Egypt and its people, but Ramesses does not back down, even oppressing his own people to maintain his position. Moses is horrified to learn from God that the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children but follows through with the plan, instructing the Hebrews to protect themselves by covering their doors with lambs\' blood. That night, all of Egypt\'s firstborn children die, including Ramesses\'s infant son. Ramesses, devastated, surrenders, allowing the Hebrews to leave.\r\n\r\nDuring the Exodus, the Hebrews follow Moses\'s original path through the desert towards the Red Sea. Still grieving his son, Ramesses assembles his army and gives chase. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. In despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which recedes and clears a path to the opposite side. Ramesses and his army continue the pursuit, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts, drowning the majority of the Egyptians who are still crossing. Moses survives and rejoins the Hebrews. Ramesses also survives, distraught over the destruction of his army.

On a train journey to visit Ruth and her father, Barry, Elly is saved from an ambush by an actual spy, Aidan Wylde, who explains to her that a devious organization, known as the Division, has targeted her because her novels seemingly predict their future. Aidan travels with Elly to England, hoping that her next chapter will reveal how to stop the Division.\r\n\r\nIn London, the duo search for a \"Masterkey\"[b] that would help expose the Division referenced in Elly\'s novels. Suspecting Aidan wants to kill her too, Elly calls her parents for help. As they arrive, Aidan reveals that her parents are operatives of the Division, forcing him and Elly to fend them off before fleeing. Escaping to France, Aidan and former CIA deputy director Alfie Solomon reveal that Argylle is not entirely fictional: Elly is in fact agent Rachel Kylle (\"Argylle\" seemingly having been derived from \"R. Kylle\"), who was captured and brainwashed by the Division five years earlier and made to believe that Dr. Margaret Vogeler (Ruth) and Director Ritter (Barry) were her real parents. Elly put her suppressed memories into her novels in modified form; Aidan resurfaces as one of her characters, Wyatt, while Alfie reappears as her cat. With the latest Argylle novel, Rachel was about to reveal the whereabouts of the Masterkey to the world.\r\n\r\nAidan and Rachel travel to the Arabian Peninsula, where they retrieve the Masterkey, but are cornered by the Division, who return them to their base. Ritter reveals that Rachel was in actuality a double agent and one of their most loyal assets for the Division, after which she offers to interrogate and subsequently shoots Aidan. She also locates Alfie for them, but reveals that she in fact sent him the Masterkey, betraying the Division. Aidan, revealed to have been shot in non-lethal areas, reunites with Rachel, and the two fight their way through the facility. Ritter interrupts the transmission of the Masterkey to Alfie, but is fatally shot after Rachel\'s cat scratches out his eyes. Alfie and Rachel escape to outside the Division facility, revealed to be a ship, to use the satellite connection to send the Masterkey. Ruth uses a mental trigger code to force her \"daughter\" to attack Aidan until Ruth is killed by Keira, a former CIA agent. Keira had once been Rachel and Aidan\'s sister-in-arms, and was thought dead during a mission with Rachel; these events had also appeared in Elly\'s novels. Alfie finally receives the Masterkey transmission and Aidan detonates the Division\'s oil tanker headquarters.\r\n\r\nResuming her novelist persona, Rachel publishes her final Argylle novel, where at a reading, the real Argylle reveals himself, much to her shock and confusion. In a mid-credits scene, taking place twenty years earlier, a young Argylle is revealed to be a Kingsman agent, with the first novel being based on his life.', 'Argylle_Hindi_Trailer_#1___FeatTrailers(360p).mp4'),

On Arrakis, Stilgar\'s Fremen troops, including Paul and Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \"Outer World\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.\r\n\r\nStilgar tells Jessica their Reverend Mother is dying and she must become her replacement by drinking the Water of Life — a fatal poison for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend Shishakli believe the prophecy is a fabricated narrative made to manipulate the Fremen. When Paul delivers a speech about not seeking power but wanting only to fight alongside them, Chani develops respect for him.\r\n\r\nPaul and Chani fall in love as Paul embraces the Fremen ways: learning their language, taking part in rites such as riding a sandworm, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, and helping raid Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names \"Usul\" and \"Muad\'Dib\". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Harkonnen replaces his nephew Rabban as Arrakis\' ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd\'s suitability as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to seduce him to secure his genes.\r\n\r\nJessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays north, fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck who leads him to House Atreides\' hidden atomic stockpile. Feyd-Rautha attacks Sietch Tabr and kills Shishakli, forcing the survivors–including Paul–to journey south. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. Chani awakens him by mixing her tears with the liquid but is angered by his actions. Paul attains a clearer vision of the past and future, seeing an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and discovering Jessica is the Baron\'s daughter, making Paul both Atreides and Harkonnen.\r\n\r\nThe southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar for leadership, but he refuses and instead galvanizes the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. The Fremen launch a massive military strike to overwhelm Shaddam\'s forces using atomics and sandworms. They overpower the Sardaukar, while Paul kills the Baron and takes Shaddam and his entourage captive. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.\r\n\r\nPaul challenges Shaddam for the throne, demanding Irulan\'s hand in marriage. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with the atomics if they intervene. Shaddam chooses Feyd-Rautha as his champion, and Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul\'s request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul\'s signet ring. Above Arrakis, the Great Houses reject Paul\'s ascendancy, so Paul orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia see this as the beginning of Muad\'Dib\'s holy war.

Pressfield, a duke, has a heroin-addicted daughter named Laura. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled Bush) to Pearson\'s right-hand man, Raymond, for £20 million.\r\n\r\nBorn into poverty in the U.S., Pearson won a scholarship to Oxford, where he began selling marijuana before dropping out and building his criminal empire. He now plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for £400m and retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson\'s business, but he refuses. Pearson\'s lab is raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the guards, steal marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters\' horrified trainer, \"Coach\", orders them to delete the video.\r\n\r\nFollowing the raid, Pearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates as a precaution. At the request of Pressfield, he also agrees to bring Laura home. Raymond retrieves her from a council estate where she lives with other addicts. In a brawl with her flatmates, one of Raymond\'s men accidentally kills Aslan, a young Russian. Laura is returned to her parents and then dies of an overdose.\r\n\r\nCoach visits Raymond, apologises for his students\' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye\'s who had informed The Toddlers about the lab location. While attempting to escape, Phuc gets fatally run over by a train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George is then executed by one of his own men.\r\n\r\nDry Eye is actually in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson\'s business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George\'s place and still hopes to take Pearson\'s empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills his men before running out of bullets. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\r\n\r\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson\'s suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger.

Berger drops his offer to £130 million, on account of the recent disruptions, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger\'s plan, shows him Dry Eye\'s frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers £270 million compensation for the blood he now has on his hands and the cost of restoring order. Pearson admits he is not \"emotional about the money\" but because Rosalind was assaulted, he demands \"a pound of flesh\" from Berger\'s own body, anywhere Berger chooses, as compensation for this indiscretion.\r\n\r\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals he was tailing Fletcher all along. The Toddlers have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals he has also sold info to Aslan\'s father, a Russian oligarch and former KGB agent. The assassin whom Raymond killed earlier was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are ambushed by The Toddlers who want to \"solve Coach\'s problem\".

On Bayford\'s advice, Elodie accepts to help their impoverished people, and she and her family sail to Aurea. Upon meeting, Elodie and Henry initially both seem uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie’s stepmother, Lady Bayford, seeks out the queen, hoping to strengthen their familial bond, but Isabelle rebuffs attempts to become acquainted, leading Lady Bayford to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement.\r\n\r\nAfter the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. The queen, dressed as a priestess, describes the pact between the first king and the dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters for peace. Following a ceremony where their hands are cut and held together, Henry insists on carrying Elodie across the narrow path over the dragon\'s lair, then throws her into the chasm.\r\n\r\nElodie recovers from the fall, realizing that she is the actual sacrifice. While finding a way out, the dragon enters the lair and taunts her before chasing Elodie and burning her leg. After escaping the beast, Elodie discovers an illuminated cave with glowing slugs, which she collects as a light source. The dragon finds her again.

Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals were mingled, deceiving the dragon that the sacrificed princesses were Aurean royalty. The dragon refuses to believe Elodie, stating that the first king\'s assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. With the dragon at her mercy, she heals both of them with the glowing slugs.\r\n\r\nElodie then interrupts another wedding at the palace, exposing the Aureans\' treachery.
